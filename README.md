## Introduction
It is well known that in many Distributed Processing the __network__ influnce graetly the task finish time, and it could even be the _bottleneck_ of the task or the larger job.
 __Apache Hadoop__  (as well as _Apache Spark_) which is widely accpepted framework in the Big Data industry does not take into account the _network_ topology, unaware of it when running a job. The problem lies in __*Apche YARN*__ which is in charge of the allocation procedure of containers (map, reduce and am) between and inside jobs. It has a basic assumption that the processing is performed with a homogeneous computers, but when they are heterogeneous the system performance is inefficient. Thus, we have been _modifying Hadoop_ for a better partition of the data in the network, and thus minimizing the job's completion time. 

The following file includes all the needed information for using the code and reproduce the experiment as in the [article](#Contact), more useful functionalites and code during my research with _Hadoop Multi Node cluster_.

## Usage

### Running Hadoop Multi Node Cluster? Step by Step
This was tested on two different clusters:
   + Weak cluster- Three computers, each has Intel core 2 duo, 4 GB RAM, 2 cores, 150GB Disk and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
   + Strong cluster (AWS)- Four t2.xlarge, each has Intel core 2 duo, 16 GB RAM, 4 VCPU, 100GB Disk, 10 Gbps link and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
   One of the instances is a master for NameNode (NN) and Resource Manager (RM), and the rest are three slaves for Datanode (DN), and Node Manager (NM).
#### Commands Before Running Daemons
All of this commands are recommended for a running a new computer, when you have a new cluster on AWS but if not just do the steps (on _numbers_) and make sure the rest is covered.

+ USER (Skip)- Create a user, _hadoop2_, and grant it with permissions, the name of this user will be used also as the user for HDFS. 
```
sudo useradd -m hadoop2
sudo passwd hadoop2

sudo usermod -aG sudo hadoop2	#Add user 'hadoop2' with sudo group	
su hadoop2

cd
```
+ GIT (Optional to use Git)- For big files to upload we need git-lfs 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install

git config --global credential.helper cache
git clone https://github.com/razo7/Nap.git
```
+ IPV6 (Optional)- Disable ipv6, Append the following to the end of the file 
```
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf   	
	#disable ipv6
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
```
1. JAVA- Download Java 8
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```
2. ENV- Set enviroment variables (use .bashrc or use export each time, for finding jre run `sudo update-alternatives --config java`)
```
sudo nano .bashrc

#### Commands for Running Daemons

+  (Optional) Clean old temporarily files in the cluster `parallel-ssh -h $HADOOP_CONF/slaves "rm -rf $HADOOP_HOME/data/hadoop-data/*"`
+  (Optional) Clean old temporarily files, locally `rm -rf $HADOOP_HOME/data/hadoop-data/*`
1. Restart namenode and the whole HDFS space `hdfs namenode -format`
+  (Optional) Run a daemon of jobhistory for reviewing my Jobs `$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start historyserver`
2.  Run all the daemons one after another by the slaves (nodes) name and their role, one node can be only used for HDFS and not for YARN and MapReduce `start-all.sh`
3.  Creating folder in HDFS with /user/hadoop2 under my username, hadoop2, which was selected also in hdfs-site.xml. `hdfs dfs -mkdir /user` 
4. Create a folder for input and output, those folders will be the home direcory, the prefix, for input or output by the Hadoop Job you write (Java)
```
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop2
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop2/input 
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop2/output
```
### Running Job With and Without Network Awareness
Do one of the follwing when you have up and running Hadoop in your system (you can do the [@above](#running-hadoop-multi-node-cluster-step-by-step) steps).

Pattern of running my hadoop code `hadoop jar MY_JAR PACKAGE_CLASS INUPUT OUTPUT SPLIT_SIZE NUM_REDUCER DOWNLINK_VEC JOB1_NAME ROUNDS`

1. Multiway join (Java code) example of three tables, Papers, Papers-Authors, and Authors.
   + Add three tables (ACM rows: 1,818,114 -> X, 4,795,532 -> Y, 3,885,527 -> Z)
   
```
hdfs dfs -put ~/Nap/input/TextFile_MultiwayJoin/x_article.txt /user/hadoop2/input/x
hdfs dfs -put ~/Nap/input/TextFile_MultiwayJoin/y_article_author.txt /user/hadoop2/input/y
hdfs dfs -put ~/Nap/input/TextFile_MultiwayJoin/z_persons.txt /user/hadoop2/input/z
```
 
   + Run Multiway Join With _Network Awareness_- Example for running the job on a cluser of master, slave1, slave3, and slave5 nodes with a 7, 6, and 6 respected downlink rates. There are also three reducers and 24 mappers, s1=s2=10 (shared variables for the join), the job name is _oneLoop2-104-30-10-16_ and the job is run twice (for running multiple jobs one after another) 
   `hadoop jar ~/Nap/mav-had/target/mav-had-0.0.2-SNapSHOT.jar run.AcmMJSort input/x input/y input/z output/hashLoop-Full-24-3-1010-766-2 24 3 "10 10" "slave1 slave3 slave5" "7 6 6" "hashLoop-Full-24-3-1010-766-4" 10`
   
   + Run Multiway Join Without _Network Awareness_ - Example like the last command with a change in the output directory and the downlink rates (0,0,0) 
   `hadoop jar ~/Nap/mav-had/target/mav-had-0.0.2-SNapSHOT.jar run.AcmMJSort input/x input/y input/z output/hashLoop-Full-24-3-1010-000-2 24 3 "10 10" "slave1 slave3 slave5" "0 0 0" "hashLoop-Full-24-3-1010-000-4" 10`

   
2. WordCount Example
   + Add text file- Alice in the wonderland `hdfs dfs -put ~/Nap/input/TextFile_wc/alice.txt /user/hadoop2/input/alice`
   
   + Run WordCount With _Network Awareness_- Example for running the job on a cluser of master, slave1, and slave2 nodes with a 25, 10, and 20 respected downlink rates. There are also nine reducers and five mappers, the job name is _alice-000_ and the job is run twice (for running multiple jobs one after another) `hadoop jar ~/AMJ/mav-had/target/mav-had-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar run.WordCountOR2 input/alice output/alice-251020-9-1 5 9 "master slave1 slave2" "25 10 20" "alice-000" 2`

   + Run WordCount Without _Network Awareness_ - Example like the last command with a change in the output directory and the downlink rates (0,0,0)  `hadoop jar ~/AMJ/mav-had/target/mav-had-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar run.WordCountOR2 input/alice output/alice-000-9-1 5 9 "master slave1 slave2" "0 0 0" "alice-000" 2`


### How to Test Cluster Links?
Under _DownUp_SpeedTest_ directory there are few options
1. Check the average downlink results automatically by running from one node, master, `./testClusterD.sh slave1 slave2 slave3 slave4 slave5 ` or `bash testClusterD.sh slave1 slave2 slave3 slave4 slave5 ` when having five more nodes in the cluster.
This will create a 50 MB (can be adjusted) file that will be sent between each pair of nodes in the cluster using  _testNodeD.sh_ code.

   The _testClusterD.sh_ function runs in a loop _testNodeD.sh_ of the slaves from the cli (`slave1 slave2 slave3 slave4 slave5`) and writes in the end into the terminal as well as to `downLink.txt` file with the average downlink for each node.
   In addition, for using it in hadoop we care about their ratios, thus we take the their normalized downlinks instead of the original results from the test.

   The testNodeD.sh is run from one node that receives (using _scp_) a file from the rest of the nodes (the master sent him this list of nodes).
   The node is receiving the same file four times, rounds, and saves the average of these results.
   At the end, the node writes to _resFile-file_ file the average downlink between each node in the cluster and the average between all the nodes.

2. Testing downlink and uplink between a pair of nodes using `downlinkSpeed-test.sh` or `scp-speed-test.sh` or `speedtest-cli`.

### How to Collect the Job's Parameters and Make Figures?
Run JobHistory server `HADOOP_HOME/sbin/mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start historyserver` and define it also in yarn-site.xml then you can http to http://MASTER_IP_ADDRESS:19888 (check AWS connectivity, group policies) and see the all the informartion regarding all the jobs for the curren runnig cluster, for example the counters ![Image](jobHistory/JobHistory_Counters_Example.PNG)

Before running the `Nap/jobHistory/downJobHistory.py` python code, please install _selenium_ and _geckodriver_ using _Anaconda_
 ```
 conda install -c conda-forge selenium 
 conda install -c conda-forge geckodriver
 ```
 
Using `Nap/jobHistory/downJobHistory.py` we can connect to the node with Job History daemon (23.22.43.90) with cluster id _1548932257169_ and parse to xlsx file (with the prefix _jobsHistory__) the counters infromation we want for all the jobs we need.
For making figures such as in the article we have published, you can use `HadoopJobStatistics3.nb` and run it on the same directory as the xlsx files.

### Useful Commands

#### HDFS and Hadoop

1. JAR - build jar file from the current directory using POM file `mvn clean install`
2. Initialization HDFS - Format the filesystem, clear the tree of metadata, the files are lost to the master but are not deleted `hdfs namenode -format`

### Job Modification and Partitioner Class (Java) 
Here, I relate mostly to `Nap\mav-had\src\main\java\run\AcmMJSort.java` when there are three options for _Reducer class_ (IndexReduceOneLoop, HashReduceOneLoop are SQLReduce ) in the code, and _HashReduceOneLoop_ has been chosen as it has been proven to be the fastest.

For modifing Hadoop (YARN) to the network we can optimize the conatiners assignment/placement (which is hard) or use the default assignment and chaneg the data paritioning between the containers, __*when we know all the locations*__. For that we use the modified Hadoop code, hadoop directory in Nap, which writes to HDFS the mappers and reducers locations, we make the waiting time for the shuffle to minimum (zero seconds, `mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps` in _mapred-site.xml_), and run a new Partitioner class that assins the data (map output tuples) to the __"right"__ reducers.

#### Job Modification

I have managed to control the number of mappers (by manipulating the split size, see _getSplitSize_ function) and separte the mappers evenly between the reducers by changing the number of container allocations per heartbeat (`yarn.scheduler.capacity.per-node-heartbeat.multiple-assignments-enabled` and `yarn.scheduler.capacity.per-node-heartbeat.maximum-container-assignments` fields in `hadoop/etc/hadoop/capacity-scheduler.xm`) .
For more, see my [@thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54056970/how-to-suggest-a-more-balanced-allocation-of-containers-in-hadoop-cluster/54132756#54132756) in Stackoverflow.
An example-
```
  <property>

<name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.per-node-heartbeat.multiple-assignments-enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>
        Whether to allow multiple container assignments in one NodeManager
heartbeat. Defaults to true.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>

<name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.per-node-heartbeat.maximum-container-assignments</name>
    <value>7</value>
    <description>
        If multiple-assignments-enabled is true, the maximum amount of
containers that can be assigned in one NodeManager heartbeat. Defaults to
-1, which sets no limit.
    </description>
  </property>
```

#### Partitioner Class

Overriding the _Partitioner class_ with _getPartition_ that define the partition number (reducer number) for the output tuple of the mapper. In order to use the locations from the HDFS we need a _Configuration_ structure in the Partitioner class, thus our Partitioner class implements `org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configurable`, and we can override `public void setConf (Configuration conf)` and `public Configuration getConf()` functions.
In setConf we connect to HDFS for reading the containers locations and reading the downlinks we have as an input to the Hadoop job. Then, we save it to _Private static_ variables for _getPartition_ function that assigns each tuple according to the downlinks we have as an input.
It begins by choosing a node based on the downlinks rates, and the tuple's key (hash function).
Then, after we know the node we use again the tuples's key for choosing uniformly a reducer out of the running containers, _getPartition_ function  does not simply partition the data uniformly between the reducers. 

### How to Run Wonder Shaper?
Install from [@here](https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper), and then you can run wondershaper on interface eth0 and limit the downlink to 500024 bytes
``` sudo wondershaper -a eth0 -d 500024 ```

### How to Access Daemons URIs?
When running with EC2 there is a need to be on the same LAN for accesing the node and explicitly these ports.
